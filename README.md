# Dynamic topic modeling of EU-related communication
We use topic modeling to analyse discourse from EU institutions on Twitter, focusing particularly on the European Commission.
We use contextualized topic modeling through `OCTIS` on fine-tuned transformers from HuggingFace libraries.

TODO:
- Do MLM pretraining
- Train and compare topic models
- Look at engagement as a function of topics
- Look at emotional content & engagement, as well as emotions ~ topics
