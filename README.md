# Dynamic topic modeling of EU-related communication
We use topic modeling to analyse discourse from EU institutions on Twitter, focusing particularly on the European Commission.
We use contextualized topic modeling and compare it with simple models (tweetopic) and qualitative inspection.

Motivation:
- Describing dimensions of EU top-down identity as conveyed through online platforms
- Topics as a proxy for focus areas
- Reception in the public: how much and which kind of reactions do different topics convey?

Outline:
- Tuning and description of topic structure for EU commission data
- Describing and predicting engagement as a function of topics
- Describing sentiment of responses as a function of topics

To do:
- Simpler emotion models
- What to measure?
