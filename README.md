### Brief description
This repository contains code and data for the paper "From economy to identity: A data-driven analysis of the European Commissionâ€™s Twitter communication between 2010 and 2022"

### Data

We only share derivatives of the data, including Twitter IDs and extracted metrics, but no text nor engagement metrics. Note that the `data/derivatives` and `data/topic` include derivatives of the data uniquely including extracted features.
