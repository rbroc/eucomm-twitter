# Dynamic topic modeling of EU-related communication


#### TODO
- Make new exemplary tweets
- Style
    - Make plots of increase/decrease over time
    - Play again a little bit with the idea of doing an overall reduction of dimensionality
    - Reduce redundant metrics (collapse Reading, word length and sentence length, verb-to-noun ratio)?
    - Add concreteness, and other more cognitive metrics?
- Redo the predictive model with new style metrics and, potentially, time? Or remove?
- Add discussion and better framing
